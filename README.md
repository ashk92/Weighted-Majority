Weighted Majority Trainer

Java Version: 1.7 <br>
Dependencies: WEKA (jar file)

Implements a weighted majority trainer algorithm. Uses WEKA for parsing through the dataset. The weighted majority implementation used the attributes of the dataset as predictors. Hence
there may be a lower performance when compared to WM implementations that use different classifiers as the predictors.
